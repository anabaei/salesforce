## Lightning Basic
* Lightning Experience is a modern user interface, while it doesnt hava features like `fead and publisher` or `clean button` or `javascript button` or `customizing objects` but it has more features from [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/lex_migration_introduction/units/lex_migration_introduction_rightforme) 
* You can customize using users from lightening by assiging permission set or by changing in their custom profiles 
* It uses javascript in client side and apex in server side to retrive data
* Kanban view allows you to drag, drop elements 
* Choose the domain: `setup>mydomain`
* Add lightening inspector from google chrome store to inspect lightening 
* Each component has cmp file like view, css file and js controller file. To see components we have to create app and then use `<c:componentname anyattribute! />` then save and have preview click
* To add attribute we can have as 
```java
<aura:component >
 <aura:attribute name="whome" type="string" default="hello!" />
 <h1> {!v.whome} world</h1>
</aura:component >
```

## Lightning Flow
* Create program with UML. There are two automation tools: Process Builder and Cloud Flow Designer. Process builder you build processes and with Cloud Flow Design you build flows when users inputs.

* You can create Schedule as `Under Scheduled Actions> Set Schedule > Add Action > Create a Record> Task > Save`
#### Process Builder
* [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/business_process_automation/units/process_builder)
* `Setup > Process Builder > save > Add Object (add trigger) > save >  Add Criteria > save` 
* Process Builder is workflow tool and tells if some conditions meet like updating some fields, automatically update some others. For example if a company you work for change its location and you want a way to automatically update addresses of all people
* You first create a process and then select the object on which the process runs. You also make sure the process kicks off whenever a record is edited or created

#### Cloud Work Flow Designer
* It is shortcut to create for example an account from home page from [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/business_process_automation/units/flow). You define screen and then create records to make flow
* first enable it from `setup> Automation >Enable Lightning runtime`
* To create flow `setup>flow>new> drag screen into canvas> define names, fields with labels` Then drag `record create> name and assign variable accountid` then connect then save then active it.
* To add it to home page or make it Look Like Lightning `setup>builder>Lightning App Builde> new>Home Page>Clone Salesforce Default Page>drag flow to place`
* You can add flow into process designs. Some advantages is for example in process builder, you canâ€™t grab the ID of the created record and use it elsewhere but you can do so in a flow.
* Workflow only can Create, Update, Email and outbound messages but processes allow us to do a lot more, such as creating a record, launching a flow, posting to Chatter, quick actions (global actions), submit for approval and updating records.
