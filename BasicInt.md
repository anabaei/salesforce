What they can do and what type of query they are able to run
### Admin
* What is Saleforce cloud? Cloud is a particular name that salesforce uses as a service, a software as a service (SAAS). It means a product that salesforce offers online without the need to mainain your own computer server or install. There are 7 salesforce cloud.
* Cloud computing has 3 different main forms. Beside SaaS, there are other types of cloud same as Heroku or Azure which provide platforn as a service PaaS and Amazon S3 for saving images which provides infrastructure as a service IaaS. Also IaaS can include monitoring, log access, security, load balancing and clustering, as well as storage resiliency, such as backup.

1. *Sales* sale could tracks customer information and interaction and permit managers(admins) to review data from team performance and make decisions.
2. *Service* service cloud is for customer service agents and empowers them with shared data, document and rapid solution base
3. *Marketing* cloud nurtur marketing to improve emails, messages, and social experience and engage noneresponders customers while advertising tracking right contacts and personalize web wontent and connecting to sales 
4. *Analytics* perform deep data analytics using time tested methods for evaluating performance
5. *Community* cloud fasts colaboration between customers and partners and partners
6. *App* provides rapid development and deployment extending CRM 
7. *IoT* is event processing engine that connects products and devices to salesforce and gain vivid pircutre of product usage
### Agile
* Agile project management is an iterative approach to managing software development projects that focuses on continuous releases and incorporating customer feedback with every iteration
### Trigger
When you use `insert`, `update` and `upsert` statement, salesforce perform the following events in order: 
* Before salesforce executes events, browser runs javascript validation if record contains any picklist, if so check the valuses
* Loads the new record field values and overwrites the old values
* If the request came from standard UI edit page, sf check 
 1- Valid field formats
 2- Maximum field length
 * Run user defined validation rules 
 * Now execute all `before` Triggers
 * Save th record to database, but doesnt commit yet
 * Execute all `after` Triggers
 * Execute assignemtn rule
 * Execute workflow rules
 * If the reocrd was updated in workflow, fires before and after update triggers one more time
 * Execute process
 * Execute flows
 * Executes Criteria Based Sharing evaluation
 * Commits all DML operations to the database
### Data Type
#### Date
* from [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_methods_system_date.htm#apex_methods_system_date)
```java
Date myDate = Date.newInstance(1960, 2, 17);
Date newDate = mydate.addDays(2);
```
* #### DateTime, Time, ID. Object, Integer: 32-bit , Long: 64-bit number with mn -2^63, Double: same as long just can have decimal point 


### Accounts
*  Customers or individuals you do business with it can be Bussiness or person accounts
### Contacts
* Employee of the each company(Account) you work with
### Leads
* Leads are people and companies that youâ€™ve identified as potential customers
### Opportunites 
* Opportunities are deals in progress
* Opportubities can have stages baed on probablity of each

### Campaign: a tool to track teams
* A tool to track teams with leads, contracts, accounts, tasks, activitis and files and track team actions
### Report : generate any data we need to review 
* A certain report that allow measurement by creating new ones we have different types of reports and share it
### Connect to Oracle 
* Install the app from [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/projects/quickstart-lightning-connect/steps/quickstart-lightning-connect1)

------------

* Users can track activities by runing queries with their emails, accounts tasks and dates  etc they call it campaign
* Users can use different email templates or cutomoize them 
* Users can add custom fields to common data types

#### Reports Subscribers
We have to create a user on salesforce with salesforce platform licence. To do so 
- Setup-> profiles-> clone from salesforce platform licence and on editing check reports and folders 
- Create a user using same licence then go to reports and change folder of report shares
- On reports click on the icon infront of folder of reports and on drop down menu choose share with usres.
 
## Security
* Assiging a licence determines which profiles available for each user. 
* We can't delete a user, but can `Deactive` so it can't login. It is in `Users->Edit>-Active Box`. Not allowing deactive you can `freez` a user as `User page->freeze`
* `setup->Passowrd policies`
* `Set IP address` if for whole org then they still can log in outside of range need to answer challenge questiions. If `set IP address`is for a singl profile, then all users of that profile are locked out. `Setup -> Network Access or Profiles`
* Restrict login access by profile. `Setup->profiles->Login Hours`
* User's `profile` determines the objects they can access. profiles uses for minimum limitation and permission sets for more
* `Permission Sets` grant additional permissions to user. `setup -> Permission Sets -> new -> license --None- ` 
* `Field permission`: first do `setup -> Management Settings -> enable Enhanced Profile User`. In some cases, you want users to have access to an object, but limit their access to individual fields
* Control access to record from `setup -> Sharing Settings -> `. Select `private` records makes them only visible to owners and roles above them in hierarchy. using `Grant Access Using Hierarchies checkbox` disable accing to users above owner. 
* Role Hierarchy `setup -> role`. Needed for `Public Group` a group of users to extend access beyond role hierarchy. `public group-> new ` then `sharing setting -> Sharing Rules -> new -> select from which users/objects -> select to which users/obejcts -> select what type of sharing -> save!`
* You can change accessing to object fields by checking value of each field `Setup> Security Controls> Sharing Settings> Manage sharing settings for 'any object you want'--> New` from this [link](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F0000000AyojIAC)


## Formulate Fields
* Create new feilds which depends on other fields based on furmulate. In lightening `setup>object manager>selectobject>Fields & Relationships>new >Formula> select type (text for ex)> then assign it`
* To convert `DateTime datatype` to `Date` need DATEVALUE() as `TODAY () - DATEVALUE(CreatedDate)`
* To have a summary field in total for example sum of all accounts we use `Roll-up` as `setup>object manager>Account>Feild & Relations>New>Roll-up>sum>Aggregate Field`

## Validatation
* Validation rules verify that data entered by users in records meet standards. You can create validation rules for objects, fields, campaign members, or case milestones. In lightening `setup>object manager> Account> Validation Rule> LEN( AccountNumber) != 8 ` or date  must be in curret year`YEAR( My_Date__c ) <> YEAR ( TODAY() )` more example from [link](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trails/force_com_dev_beginner/modules/point_click_business_logic/units/validation_rules)

## DE
* Apex is a strongly typed, object-oriented language that allows developers to execute flow and transaction-control statements on the Lightning Platform platform server, in conjunction with calls to the Lightning Platform APIs. Example of sending email [code](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/developer_console/units/developer_console_source_code)
* Execute classes Anonymous as `Debug | Open Execute Anonymous Window`
* Logs are cumulative. from the least amount of data logged (level = NONE) to the most (level = FINEST) as levels increase it covers more logs [link](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/developer_console/units/developer_console_logs?trailmix_creator_id=00550000006yDdKAAU&trailmix_id=platform-essentials-for-devs). `Debug > change log level>add/change`
* Customize logs view from `debug>view log panel> select> save as perspective select from debug`
* Checkpoint to see details of code. first assign level of log of `apex code ` to `finest`. Then select line you want by adding a `red .` on left side then `run program> checkpoint tab> click on the file in checkpoint table > select heap tab> click on class name> click on instances table > see details`

## SOSL vs SOQL
* If I want to find a word `crisis` and dont know which field of objects should I search I use SOSL but if I knew which field of object I am looking for I use SOQL which is the equivalent of a SELECT SQL. SOSL is like below to search throuhg all contants fields and resurn with similiar and not exaxt results because it is index search which is faster and has more cool features as this [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trails/force_com_dev_beginner/modules/search_solution_basics/units/search_solution_basics_choosing)
```java
List<List<sObject>> searchList = [FIND 'Crisis' IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Contact(FirstName, LastName), Account(name), Campaign]; // so inside searchList[0 ] there is list of results.
```
SOSL within multiple objects. You can add which fields like by adding `IN email FIELDS RETURNING`.
* To optimize SOSL define synonyme groups in `Setup> Synonyms> SelectSynonyms`

## Lightning Flow
* Create program with UML. There are two automation tools: Process Builder and Cloud Flow Designer. Process builder you build processes and with Cloud Flow Design you build flows when users inputs.

* You can create Schedule as `Under Scheduled Actions> Set Schedule > Add Action > Create a Record> Task > Save`
#### Process Builder
* [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/business_process_automation/units/process_builder)
* `Setup > Process Builder > save > Add Object (add trigger) > save >  Add Criteria > save` 
* Process Builder is workflow tool and tells if some conditions meet like updating some fields, automatically update some others. For example if a company you work for change its location and you want a way to automatically update addresses of all people
* You first create a process and then select the object on which the process runs. You also make sure the process kicks off whenever a record is edited or created

#### Cloud Work Flow Designer
* It is shortcut to create for example an account from home page from [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/business_process_automation/units/flow). You define screen and then create records to make flow
* first enable it from `setup> Automation >Enable Lightning runtime`
* To create flow `setup>flow>new> drag screen into canvas> define names, fields with labels` Then drag `record create> name and assign variable accountid` then connect then save then active it.
* To add it to home page or make it Look Like Lightning `setup>builder>Lightning App Builde> new>Home Page>Clone Salesforce Default Page>drag flow to place`
* You can add flow into process designs. Some advantages is for example in process builder, you canâ€™t grab the ID of the created record and use it elsewhere but you can do so in a flow.
* Workflow only can Create, Update, Email and outbound messages but processes allow us to do a lot more, such as creating a record, launching a flow, posting to Chatter, quick actions (global actions), submit for approval and updating records.
### Approvals
* Create email template `setup>template>select html> select one letterhead(if dont have create)>`
* start approval `setup> approval process> opportunity> Create New Approval Process | Use Jump Start Wizard> ` then define `Initial Submission Actions ` and `Final Approval Actions`

## Custom Metadata
* Custom metadata types let you use records to configure your app without worrying about migrating those records to other orgs. So in custom setting you should create same metadata in dev environment then to sandbox and then in production but with custom metadata we can use packages to transfer metadata, records and some functions
* Create an app to define which vacation is available for each account tier need to develop and deploy to production env. 
* Create a metadata `setup> Custom Metadata Types> new` then create custom fields and in details page `manage name` add records
* In Test you should add `@IsTest(SeeAllData=true) ` to read metadata as well
* You can use custom metadata relationship to connect with other metadatas and as connected table among two entities
* We can create objects here as well by draging from left side bar and can add fields to object by draging them into object a good [source](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trails/force_com_dev_intermediate/modules/custom_metadata_types/units/custom_metadata_types_create_md_relationships)

## Static Resource
* `setup> static > new> upload and save as mm` thne inside VF page you have `<apex:stylesheet value="{!URLFOR($Resource.mm2)}" />` then you have your stylesheet in VF. for images we have `<apex:image url="{!$Resource.mmm} />` directly embed into VF page. 

## Schema Builder
* Schema Builder is a tool that lets you visualize and edit your data model. It shows field values, required fields, and how objects are related, by displaying lookup and master-detail relationships
* Also we can manage permission for custom fields directly `right click on field> manage permission` 

# Mobile apps
* After creating users can download them from app store
## Create Global Action
* `setup>Global Actions>new> select object> select which tabs to display> assign predefined options > save`
* Global actions let users create records, but the new record has no relationship with other records. And theyâ€™re called global actions because they can be put anywhere actions are supportedâ€”on record detail pages, but also places like the feed or Chatter groups.
## Object-specific actions
* Differences between global actions and Object-specific actions. Object-specific actions can update records and create records that are automatically associated with related information. Also to make them visible into mobile app, we dont add them into layout we just make available to users
## Compact layout 
* When opening a record in SF mobile app, you can see highlights from fields which we call them compact layout.
* Create a layout: `object managment settings for contacts> compact layout>new` 
* Assign it : System use default layouts unless we tell `object management> compact layout > click on a compact> compact layout assignment > select primary layout> save`
## Navigation Mobile
* To access visualforce pages in mobile app we need creating tabs
* To change the navigation menu `setup>Salesforce Navigation> save`
* More on mobile app dev is [here](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trails/salesforce1_mgmt/modules/salesforce1_rollout)


* In account settings we should allow users to relate a contact to multiple accounts.
