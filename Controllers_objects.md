#### Controllers
* To access objects from an standard controller and display them as customize data we use it as 
```java
public class conVsGood {
Contact c;
public Contact getContactMethod1() {
        if(c == null) c = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Contact LIMIT 1];
    //    System.debug(c);
        return c;
    }
    }
```
* And inside the apex:page
```java
<apex:page controller="conVsGood">
    getContactMethod1(): {!contactMethod1.name}
</apex:page>
```
### Set permission to users
* Subusers usually dont access to pages created by admin. To do that 
- Go to Set permission and create a new one
- Assign the licence which your target user carry on
- After creating a set permission, go to edit 
- Click on visualforce page access and select pages you want to allow users 
- Done!
